# Product Context

## Problem Statement
The user needs a professional online presence to showcase their work at Gauntlet AI. Existing solutions might be too generic or slow. A custom portfolio allows for specific features like video-first project previews and a tailored design system.

## User Experience Goals
- **Immediacy**: Projects should be visible immediately on the homepage without unnecessary clicks or scrolling through a large hero section.
- **Clarity**: Information should be presented clearly with a focus on visual content (videos).
- **Smoothness**: Interactions (modals, theme toggling) should be seamless.
- **Professionalism**: The design should reflect a high standard of engineering and design capability.

## User Workflows
1. **Visitor lands on Home**: Sees a grid of project cards.
2. **Visitor hovers card**: Sees a play icon or animation indicating video content.
3. **Visitor clicks card**: Opens a modal with the full video and details.
4. **Visitor navigates**: Uses the header to read the About page or Contact the developer.
5. **Visitor switches theme**: Toggles between light and dark mode based on preference.
