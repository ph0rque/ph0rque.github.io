# Active Context

## Current State (October 12, 2025)
The portfolio website is **functional and deployed** with:
- ✅ Homepage with project grid
- ✅ Project cards with modals
- ✅ About page with bio
- ✅ Contact page with form
- ✅ Dark/light theme toggle
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Basic testing setup

## Recent Changes
- Initial setup complete
- Core features implemented
- Working git repository (clean working tree)

## Active Focus
**Homepage Redesign** - Major layout overhaul with comprehensive PRD complete:
- ✅ Vertical split-screen layout (Left: About+Contact, Right: Projects)
- ✅ Phoenix logo as 25% center divider, animates to header on scroll
- ✅ Synchronized scrolling between sides
- ✅ New color scheme extracted from phoenix logo
- ✅ Complete design system documented
- ✅ Responsive strategy defined (vertical stack on mobile)

## Current Work Item
**Implementation Complete** - All 9 phases finished, slot rendering fixed, ready for final push

## Next Immediate Steps
1. ✅ Memory bank initialized
2. ✅ Clarifying questions answered
3. ✅ Detailed PRD created (homepage-redesign-PRD.md)
4. Begin implementation:
   - Phase 1: Design System Setup
   - Phase 2: Layout Implementation
   - Phase 3: Logo Animation
   - Phase 4: Content Migration
   - Phase 5: Polish & Testing
   - Phase 6: Cleanup

## Decisions Made
- ✅ Left: About + Contact, Right: Projects
- ✅ Logo: 25% of page, static divider that shrinks/moves to header on scroll
- ✅ Synchronized scrolling
- ✅ Mobile: Vertical stack
- ✅ Remove separate About/Contact pages
- ✅ Keep modal system for projects
- ✅ Light mode: Lightest purple bg (#e8d4f1), orange accent (#ff7b3d)
- ✅ Dark mode: Darkest blue bg (#0a1628), orange accent (#ff7b3d)

## Known Considerations
- Must maintain accessibility standards
- Performance should remain high (Lighthouse > 90)
- Mobile responsiveness critical
- Existing project data structure preserved
- Theme toggle still needed for new design system
