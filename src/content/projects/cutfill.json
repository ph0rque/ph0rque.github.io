  "fullDescription": "CutFill is a browser-based 3D game designed to teach cut-and-fill earthworks principles through hands-on terrain manipulation. Built during Week 5 of the Gauntlet AI intensive program and enhanced with ongoing refinements, this project demonstrates rapid prototyping and production-quality software development using modern web technologies. The game features realistic 3D terrain manipulation volume operations, requiring players to balance cut and fill operations to maintain volume equilibrium. The planning workflow allows users to plan operations with visual overlays before execution, providing an educational focus on real-world engineering principles through hands-on simulation.",
