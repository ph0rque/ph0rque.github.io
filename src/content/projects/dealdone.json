  "fullDescription": "DealDone is a desktop application designed to streamline the complex document management process in business acquisitions and M&A deals. Upon installation, it creates an organized folder structure on your desktop where you can store template files. When you drag and drop deal documents into the designated folder, DealDone automatically categorizes them - NDAs go to the legal folder, financial statements to the financial folder, and CIMs to the general folder. The app analyzes these documents in the background, populating your templates with extracted data and saving the results to an analysis folder with confidence levels that improve over time. As you add more documents from sellers or brokers, DealDone continuously updates its analysis. You can manually edit the auto-filled templates, and the system learns from your corrections.",
