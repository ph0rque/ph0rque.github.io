          Hi, I'm Andrew Shindyapin! I'm a Product Manager and Web Developer with over a decade of experience helping teams build meaningful solutions. 
          Currently part of Gauntlet AI Cohort 2, I'm passionate about using AI to create products that genuinely help people and make complex 
          processes simpler.
        </p>
        
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          My Gauntlet app-building journey has taken me through clean tech, real estate, and healthcare, where I've built everything from AI-powered
          real estate tools to business acquisition apps. I love working with and technology that works well with AI-driven development (almost all of them)
          to transform ambitious ideas into user-friendly products. I've had the privilege of working with teams at Vitu, Select Rehab, and Figment,
          where we built scalable solutions that made a real difference.
        </p>
        
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          As a Ycombinator Fellowship alum and founder of AutoMicroFarm, I'm motivated by creating technology that has a positive impact. 
          I believe in lean methodologies and Domain-Driven Design, and I'm excited about shaping the future of AI-driven innovation. 
          When I'm not coding or strategizing, you'll find me exploring new technologies and thinking about how we can use them to solve 
          real problems. Let's build something amazing together!
        </p>
