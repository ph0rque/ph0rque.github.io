          My development journey began with Ruby on Rails in 2006. Since then, I've developed expertise across multiple domains 
          including web development, product management, and emerging AI technologies. I've created web, desktop, and mobile apps 
          while studing at Gauntlet AI. As a multilingual professional (fluent in English, German, and Russian), I bring diverse 
          perspectives to problem-solving. My passion lies in creating innovative technological solutions that  solve real-world
          challenges, always pushing the boundaries of what's possible in software development and product design.
